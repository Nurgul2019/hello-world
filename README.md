first try
Today is Sunday, June 23, 2019. I need to get a cup of coffee and wake up, or I am going to die. Let's see... Karnei needs to apologize or this is never going to end. Also, apology is supposed to mean something. It's not only a way of saying, "I am sorry", but also, it is a way of making promise (without saying it out loud), that similar thing will never happen again, and a way to acknowledge that person has learned from this experience, mistake.
Otherwise, it's all good!
